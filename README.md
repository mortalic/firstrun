# Fedora Post-Installation Setup Script

This script automates the setup of a Fedora system, including enabling repositories, installing essential software, and configuring devices. It's designed to run after a fresh installation of Fedora, helping users quickly set up their environment according to their needs.

## Features

- **RPM Fusion Repository**: Enables the RPM Fusion free and non-free repositories, essential for multimedia packages and other software not included in the official Fedora repositories.
- **Multimedia Codecs**: Installs multimedia groups for enhanced media playback capabilities.
- **Conditional Software Installation**: Prompts the user to install various applications such as Syncthing, Steam, Discord, Git, Flatpak, Signal, Beyond All Reason, Codium, and Nvidia Drivers. The user can choose to install or skip each application.
- **Drive Setup**: Offers to set up a mount point for a secondary drive, automatically adding it to the `fstab` for persistent mounting.
- **User and Permissions Management**: Sets the owner and permissions for the newly created mount point.

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository or download the script**:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-directory>
    ```

2. **Make the script executable**:
    ```bash
    chmod +x setup_fedora.sh
    ```

3. **Run the script**:
    ```bash
    sudo ./setup_fedora.sh
    ```

Or, if you are lazy, here is a oneliner with curl:

```bash
curl -s -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mortalic/firstrun/main/fedora_first_run.sh | sudo bash
```
